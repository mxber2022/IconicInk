# IconicInk

IconicInk is a platform where celebrities or influencers can collaborate with their fans to create AI-generated art. The process is interactive and personalizedâ€”both the celebrity and an approved fan can edit the AI prompt together and chat, adding a creative and collaborative touch to the final result. Once the image is generated, the celebrity can digitally(custom) sign it, adding authenticity and mint it as an NFT and transferring ownership to the fan. This platform merges fan engagement with creative co-creation, allowing for unique, signed digital artwork that embodies the collaboration between celebrities and their fans.

## Features
- **Collaborative AI Art Creation**: Celebrities and fans work together in real-time to edit AI-generated art prompts.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Celebrities and fans communicate directly during the creative process, exchanging ideas and refining the prompt.
